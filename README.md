# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning

Introduction to neural networks. Fully connected and convolutional layers. 

Some possibilities of neural networks (including recurrent ones) are considered. In addition to the classification of photos, here you can find projects related to the generation of signatures for photos, a project on autoencoders and others.
